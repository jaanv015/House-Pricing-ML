# House-Pricing-ML

## Description
House price prediction can assist developers in determining the selling price of a home and customers in determining the best time to buy a home. 
Three factors determineÂ the price of a house: physical conditions, concept, and location.
The goal of this statistical analysis is to help us understand the relationship between house features and 
how these variables are used to predict house price.

## Implementation

The decision tree classifier has been used for the analysis of Price range per sq.ft. 
If the price range is less than or equal to 1 lakh then, it displays lower class. If the price range is 
between 1 lakh to 5 lakh, then it displays middle class, else if the price range is greater 
than 5 lakhs, then it displays upper class.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy score has been used to determine the acuuracy of the model.
