# House-Pricing-ML

## Description
House price prediction can assist developers in determining the selling price of a home and customers in determining the best time to buy a home. 
Three factors determineÂ the price of a house: physical conditions, concept, and location.
The goal of this statistical analysis is to help us understand the relationship between 
house features and how these variables are used to predict house prices.

## Implementation

The decision tree classifier has been used to analyse the Price range per sq. ft. 
If the price range is less than or equal to 1 lakh, it displays lower class. If the price range is 
between 1 lakh and 5 lakh, then it displays the middle class; else, if the price range is greater 
than five lakhs, then it displays the upper class.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy score have been used to determine the model's accuracy.
